## Usage

1. Launch the application

If you have issues with finding or updating mods go into Settings and choose your mod directory again.

## Disclaimer

- This is my first Swift/SwiftUI app and was basically just cobbled together as a learning experience. It is very flawed and looks like it was thrown together by a toddler.
