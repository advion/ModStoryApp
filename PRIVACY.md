# Privacy Policy for ModStory

Effective Date: January 1, 2025

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how ModStory ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our application.

## Information We Collect
ModStory is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:

### Information You Provide
- **File System Access**: We only access files and directories that you explicitly select through the app's file picker. This access is used solely for reading and managing mod files.
- **Settings**: Preferences and configuration options you set within the app are stored locally on your device.

### Automatically Collected Information
- **Application Logs**: Error and diagnostic information is collected locally on your device to help troubleshoot issues. These logs are not transmitted to our servers.
- **API Requests**: When checking for mod updates, the app makes requests to public mod databases. These requests include mod identifiers but no personal information.

## How We Use Information
The information collected is used exclusively for:
- Managing your mod files as directed by you
- Checking for available mod updates from public databases
- Improving app functionality
- Troubleshooting technical issues

## Information Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties. The app communicates only with public mod databases to fetch mod information and updates.

### Legal Requirements
We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests.

## Data Storage
All data is stored locally on your device. We do not transmit or store your personal data on remote servers. Mod information is fetched from public APIs but your personal information is not shared.

## Your Rights and Choices
You can reset all app data by deleting the application's container directory or uninstalling the application.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the effective date.
